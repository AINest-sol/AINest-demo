👨‍🚀 Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with AINest is the automatic setup CLI bundled with the project.

Prerequisites :point_up:

## Prerequisites :point_up:

Before you get started, please make sure you have the following installed:

- An editor of your choice. For example, [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). After installation, please create an account, open up the Docker application, and sign in.
- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
- A [Serper API Key](https://serper.dev/signup) (optional)
- A [Replicate API Token](https://replicate.com/signin) (optional)

## Getting Started :rocket:
1. **Open your editor**

2. **Open the Terminal** - Typically, you can do this from a 'Terminal' tab or by using a shortcut
   (e.g., `Ctrl + ~` for Windows or `Control + ~` for Mac in VS Code).

3. **Clone the Repository and Navigate into the Directory** - Once your terminal is open, you can clone the repository and move into the directory by running the commands below.

   **For Mac/Linux users** :apple: :penguin:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AINest-sol/AINest-demo.git
   cd AgentN
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   **For Windows users** :windows:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AINest-sol/AINest-demo.git
   cd AgentN
   ./setup.bat
   ```
4. **Follow the setup instructions from the script** - add the appropriate API keys, and once all of the services are running, travel to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your web-browser.

Happy hacking! :tada:
